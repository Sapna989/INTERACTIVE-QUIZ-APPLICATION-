This project is a responsive and interactive Quiz Application created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It displays one multiple-choice question at a time, and users have 20 seconds to choose the correct answer. The quiz includes a real-time countdown timer, a progress bar to show how far the user has reached, and a popup summary at the end that displays the total correct and wrong answers along with the time taken.

The interface is clean and modern, using the Poppins font, soft colors, and smooth button effects. The application also has a Dark Mode Toggle, allowing users to switch between light and dark themes easily. When a user selects an answer, immediate feedback is given—correct answers turn green, and incorrect ones turn red.

All quiz questions and answers are stored in a JavaScript array, making it simple to update or add more questions. No external libraries or frameworks are used, which makes it a great project for beginners learning vanilla JavaScript, DOM manipulation, and basic front-end design.

The application works well on both desktop and mobile screens. It’s a great practice project for building interactive UI features and understanding the flow of a quiz system from start to finish.
